# Personal website of Alex Yuly

Navigate to [alexyuly.github.io](alexyuly.github.io) to see my personal website.

It's a sandbox for my programming thoughts and ideas.

## Development

1) Make sure you have Node.js and the Yarn package manager installed.
2) Run `yarn` to install dependencies.
3) Run `yarn build` to build the website for production. Commit and push the result to see it live.
4) Run `yarn build-debug` to build a debug version of the website, not suitable for production. (See `index-debug.html`.)
